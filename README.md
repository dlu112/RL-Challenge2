# RL-Challenge2

## Objective
Develop a software system using Python to test hardware devices that support the
same commands but various communication protocols such as Ethernet, RS-422, or RS-485. All devices accept string commands and return the same string to indicate successful command execution. The software should support two testing procedures, QUICK and FULL tests.
